# Karachi-Railway
INTRODUCTION
Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) is a defunct
regional public transit
system in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan, which served
the Karachi metropolitan area between 1969 and
1999. Revival of the railway has been proposed. With
its hub at Karachi City station on I. I. Chundrigar
Road, KCR's revived operations would extend as far
as Gadapto the north, Dhabeji to the east, Kiamari to
the south and Hub to the west. KCR is intended to be
an inter-regional in Karachi which would connect
several industrial and commercial districts within the
city to the outlying suburbs.[1] The revival effort of
KCR have been proposed several times since
becoming defunct, though remained unfulfilled due to
lack of financial and political backing
